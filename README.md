# VinSynth
A monophonic synthesizer with an interpolated delay effect, a lo-fi bitcrusher, and lowpass highpass filters.
Made as a project in MMI 604 Audio Software Development class.

The Biquad Direct Form 2 using RBJ's equations does not work well. A Butterworth filter will be added instead.

Inspired by Vincent Vega. If you haven't watched Pulp Fiction, please do. Please.
